<div class="infocontent">
	<p>In this iconic image, one can realize the size of the ATLAS
		detector, compared to the person in the bottom part of the picture.
		The detector is not completely built yet, but the eight toroid magnets
		are now in place; we can also see the calorimeter at the center,
		before being moved to the center of the detector.</p>

	<p>But why do we need such big magnets? Charged particles passing
		through a magnetic field are bent, proportionally to the particle's
		energy and the strength of the magnetic field: the higher the
		particle's energy, the stronger the magnetic field has to be to bend
		the particle. Thus, if we know the strength of the magnetic field and
		we measure how much the particle bends along its trajectory, we can
		infer its energy. That is why in ATLAS we need such enormous magnets:
		being the energy of the particles produced in the LHC collisions very
		high, we need a very strong magnetic field to bend them enough to be
		able to measure their trajectories accurately.</p>

		The eight big magnets in the picture are part of the outer system of
		the ATLAS detector, the so-called <a

				spectrometer</i></a>, designed to reveal and measure the properties of the
		particles called <a

<div class="infonote">

	<p>November 2005... if I remember well, at that time I was studying
		Theoretical Physics in Rome, towards my Master degree (the Italian
		"Laurea Specialistica," indeed). I didn't know that I would have done
		a Ph.D. on the ATLAS experiment, yet!</p>
