	<p>...and, finally, the announcement! The two general-purpose
		experiments at the LHC ---ATLAS and CMS--- have finally collected and
		analyzed a fair amount of events showing features compatible with the
		Higgs boson and, on the 4th of June 2012, <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2272973">
        they jointly announce its discovery</a>!</p>

	<p>In the picture, Peter Higgs and Francois Englert are waiting for
		the start of the seminar which will confirm the theory they proposed 50
		years earlier...</p>

	<h2>A personal note</h2>
</div>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>On that day...well, I was at work at CERN, of course! Everybody
		was waiting for the joint seminar. Of course, we from ATLAS knew the
		content of the ATLAS talk, already; and rumors had run, in the days
		before, about the content of the talk from the other experiment, CMS.
		But the excitement was very high, anyway!</p>
	<p>Personally, I was looking forward to seeing Higgs' and Englert's
		reaction. After the announcement, it has been nice to see the joy and
		the satisfaction on their faces.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Small note</i>: on the 4th of June 2003 the ATLAS cavern was
		inaugurated. Nine years later, after having built the detector 
        and started taking data, one of the biggest discovery in
		particle physics was announced!
