	<h2>What's on the picture?</h2>

		The picture shows a very crowded collision between two bunches of
		heavy lead ions. For the most of the data taking period, LHC collides
		bunches of protons. As a result, a large quantity of energy is
		collected at the impact spot. For some specific research lines,
		however, the quantity of energy collected in the tiny space of the
		collision point is not enough: a larger, so-called, <i>energy
			density</i> is required, that is a larger quantity of energy in the same
		tiny space.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of those is the study of the so-called <a
			href="https://home.cern/about/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma"><i>quark-gluon
				plasma</i></a>. This studies the primordial status of Universe just a few
		instants after the great Big Bang: a <i>plasma</i> ---let us think of
		it as a dense fluid--- of free <a
			href="https://home.cern/about/physics/standard-model">quarks and
			gluons</a>, which are the components of all the ordinary matter we know
		today. Under normal conditions, it is not possible to separate them
		apart and make them free. However, if we get a very large quantity of
		energy in a very narrow space ---that is, a high <i>energy density</i>---,
		then we can replicate the conditions we think they were present just
		after the Big Bang, and we can study the behavior of the quarks and
		gluons in much more detail.
	</p>

	<p>
		One way to obtain a large energy density at LHC is changing the
		colliding particles. By using "heavier" particles, we can get higher
		energy density at the collision point. Lead nuclei contain many
		protons and neutrons, making them ideal candidates to act as heavier
		colliding objects. The lead atoms are deprived of their electrons,
		transforming them into "lead ions," and then injected into the LHC and
		accelerated. The energy produced by the collisions of those bunches of
		<i>heavy-ions</i> is high enough to keep the quarks and the gluons
		free for an instant, before colling down and recombining together in a
		plethora of particles. Those are visualized in the picture like yellow
		tracks.
	</p>

	<p>This picture shows one of the first lead ions collisions of
		2015, and it is part of the ATLAS events shown at the LHC seminar on
		physics results from the data taking period known as "Run2" (the talk
		was given by M. Kado, on behalf of the whole ATLAS Collaboration).</p>

	<h2>A personal note</h2>
</div>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>I remember very well when we were preparing the event displays
		for the public seminar. Among other types of event, to present both
		our latest technical achievements and physics results, we wanted to
		show a heavy-ion collision as well. The team working on this spent
		some days searching for the right event, reconstructing it and trying
		different visualization, in order to show the complexity in the
		analysis of heavy-ion collisions and to illustrate our findings.</p>
		
	<p>I personally really like this image, and it is one of my favorite event displays: I find it very detailed, as
		well as very illustrative for the general public, ...and with the
		right amount of the "Wow" factor!</p>
