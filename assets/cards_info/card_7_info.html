<div class="infocontent">
	<p>In pictures like this one, called "event displays," we can take
		a look at what happens inside the ATLAS detector.</p>

	<p>When the two proton beams from LHC collide, many particles are
		created because of the high energy of the collision; some of those
		particles interact with each other, some others decay giving birth to
		other particles, others aggregate. When a particle interacts with the
		detectors, signals are created, revealing us where that particle has
		passed, its energy and its nature.</p>

	<p>
		In the figure here we can see what happened in the inner part of the
		detector, just after that specific collision. Two heavy <i>Z</i>
		particles are created, which, after a very short life, decay giving
		birth to four particles called "muons": the 4 red tracks coming out
		from the center. This type of event is often called the "golden one"
		because it is an event which is free of large "noise" and it is
		considered one of the best types of event where the Higgs boson could
		be found.
	</p>

	<p>The image is from 2011. At that time it was not considered
		produced by the decay of a Higgs boson yet because the measurements
		had to be verified with more data.</p>

	<p>
		Many other types of events are studied by the ATLAS experiment, and <a

	<h2>A personal note</h2>
</div>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>At that time I was part of the <a
			href="https://atlas.cern/discover/detector/trigger-daq">ATLAS
			Data Acquisition group</a>; I was in the second year of my CERN
		Fellowship, and I was working on the Run Control system. The Run
		Control is the system which takes care of the correct configuration of
		all the subsystems which compose the ATLAS detector. Each piece has to
		be switched on and off at the right time, and correctly configured, to
		assure a successful data taking.</p>
		
	<p>I remember the discussions about the first events which could be
		a sign of the presence of a Higgs boson. Of course, the events had to
		be confirmed by taking a number of events which could be considered
		statistically significant; but the excitement was already
		increasing...</p>
