		The ATLAS experiment has been designed, and it is run, by a
		collaboration of physicists. At the time of writing this little note,
		we are about 3000 physicists, coming from 182 universities and
		institutes from 38 different countries. We can take a look at the list
		of ATLAS authors in <a
			href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/Publications">all
			papers published by the ATLAS Collaboration</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can also take a look at the list of <a
			href="http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/Management/Institutions.html">all
			institutes which are part of the ATLAS Collaboration</a>, as well as <a
			href="https://atlas.cern/discover/collaboration">visualizing them
			on an interactive map</a>.
	</p>

	<p>Let us browse through the countries listed there, and we will
		realize how ATLAS is an example of a successful project, gathering
		people coming from such different countries to work together in a
		harmonious way towards a common goal. Even people coming from
		countries that are officially in conflict, here in ATLAS they work
		together.</p>

	<p>Science, education, and knowledge are and should be above
		borders, conflicts, political problems or mere national issues.
		Science should always gather ideas and people from all places and all
		social situations. Moreover, science should always be open and
		accessible to everyone: all brilliant minds should be able to
		contribute to the common knowledge, without barriers and without being
		excluded because of the history, the nationality, the gender, their
		personality, their handicaps and the personal attitudes and
		preferences.</p>

	<p>The picture shows several hundreds of ATLAS physicists coming
		from US institutes (out of about 2000 at the time it was taken, in
		2008). It is a really nice picture, I think,: it can give a sense of
		the size of the ATLAS collaboration; even if the number of today's
		ATLAS physicists are much larger than those represented in the
		picture.</p>

	<h2>A personal note</h2>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>At the time of that picture, I was back at CERN. Since two years
		already, I had started working on the ATLAS experiment again, and
		since March 2008 I was based at CERN, sent there by the University of
		Freiburg, where I was studying for my Ph.D. in Particle Physics.</p>
		
	<p>As said, the picture shows a group of physicists coming from US
		institutes. At that time, I didn't know that, a few years later, I
		would have been employed by a US university, as well!</p>
