	<p>The two last big pieces of the ATLAS detector are ready at
		building 182 on CERN site, waiting to be lowered into the underground
		cavern. They are the two ATLAS "muon small wheels," which have been
		designed and built to detect the particles called "muons" created in
		the collision, which travel through the forward and backward regions
		of the detector. Those two big pieces would be placed one at each end
		of the ATLAS detectors, like two caps.</p>

	<h2>A personal note</h2>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>In those years I was working on the development of data analysis
		strategies to reveal hints of the existence of <a
			href="https://home.cern/about/physics/supersymmetry"><i>Supersymmetric</i>
			particles</a>. We did not have experimental data yet ---the data taking
		period would start later that year---, but we created simulated data
		to test our analysis tools.</p>
		
	<p>Also, after the start of data taking, I started taking shifts in the <a
			href="https://atlas.cern/tags/control-room">ATLAS control room</a>,
		at the "Muon desk." There, I monitored the good and correct behavior
		of muon chambers; among them, the "small wheels" shown in the picture.</p>
		
	<p>For a Ph.D. student like me, it was very cool being there in the
		Control Room: it was like being in the pilothouse of a big,
		sophisticated ship!</p>
