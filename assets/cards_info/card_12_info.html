    <h2>What's on the picture?</h2>

<div class="infocontent">
    <p>The activities around and on the ATLAS detector never stop.
        To run at the energy frontier and to get the most from the
        collisions provided by the LHC, new techniques and methods are
        continuously taken into consideration and studied, and the
        detector has updated from time to time.</p>
    <p>In the picture, taken in 2014, two ATLAS members are
        installing a new layer of particle detectors close to the
        interaction point, where the particle beams, accelerated by the
        LHC, collide. The introduction of this new layer, called IBL
        (Internal B Layer), allows a more precise measurement of the
        particle tracks in the region near the collision. It also allows
        a better reconstruction of so-called "secondary vertices", spots
        where particles produced in thev collision decay, giving birth
        to new particles. The introduction of the IBL sub-detector was
        planned years ahead; but it was not possible to install it at
        the start of the ATLAS Experiment, because of the conditions of
        the LHC beams: being close to the collision point, in fact, it
        can be installed only if the colliding beams are very stable, to
        avoid damages from the accelerated particle hitting the detector
        itself. That's why, from the beginning, the insertion of the IBL
        it has been planned as an update of the ATLAS detector, to be
        handled some years after the start, when particle beams from the
        LHC would be stable.</p>
    <!-- ??? TODO: check and explain IBL  -->
    <p>Beside the "normal" update (if we can use the word "normal"
        when talking about a detector which has the size of a cathedral
        and about the weight of the Eiffel tower!), studies for future
        modifications and upgrades are ongoing as well.</p>
    <p>In these years, LHC is happily running and we, the
        experiments, are taking data out of that. But there are plans to
        extend the accelerator's possibilities in the near future. When
        that happens, the number of collisions will increase, and the
        experiments on the accelerator have to be prepared to take and
        handle that increased amount of data.</p>
    <p>Hence, while a group of ATLAS physicists dedicates his daily
        work to the data taking and the analysis of those data, another
        team is working in parallel on the upgrade of the experiment to
        match our future requirements.</p>
    <p>When we talk about the "upgrade," we do not consider the
        detector alone. A modern particle physics experiment, in fact,
        is composed by a detector and the software which is used to
        drive and run it. Hence, the software used to run the experiment
        has to be upgraded as well, to be able to effectively handle the
        amount of data we will have in the future and to efficiently
        exploit the possibilities offered by the modern computing
        hardware.</p>

    <p>The ATLAS detector is a giant prototype, in the sense that
        all the equipments and sub-detectors composing it are unique
        custom pieces, especially designed and built for this
        experiment. Therefore, the software used to run all the
        equipment and to handle the experimental data has to be designed
        and built accordingly. There is no commercial software on the
        market capable of running an experiment like ATLAS. Moreover, in
        order to conceive and write a piece of software to run a
        particle physics experiment, the developer must have a deep
        knowledge of particle physics, as well. That's why, the great
        majority of software developers working on particle physics
        experiments are particle physicists themselves, helped in the
        more technical tasks by a group of expert software engineers and
        computer scientists.</p>

    <p>Since several years, we are in the process of upgrading our
        software: we are modernizing it by using the latest coding
        standards, and we are updating our software framework to make
        use of the most recent techniques and advances in software
        development and the latest hardware.</p>

    <h2>A personal note</h2>
</div>

<div class="infonote">

    <p>
        Since several years, I am involved in the design, development,
        and maintenance of the so-called "Core Software," the set of
        tools which compose the software framework of the ATLAS
        experiment. This framework is the foundation for all the
        operations on the experimental data once they have been
        collected, whose target is the <i>reconstruction</i> of what
        happened at the exact moment of the collision between the two
        proton beams.
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular, I am leading the development of software tools to
        <a href="https://atlas-vp1.web.cern.ch/atlas-vp1/home/">visualize
            data interactively, with 3D graphics</a>, and to handle those
        pieces of data which store the geometrical description of the
        all the ATLAS sub-detectors.
    </p>

    <p>Interactive data visualization plays a key role in a particle
        physics experiment. While designing a new experiment, or while
        upgrading an existing one, we have to edit the geometrical
        description of the detector's elements, and they use
        visualization tools 
        <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2148236/files/ATLAS_VP1_event_display_first_stable_beam_collisions_13TeV_many-vertices_run296942_evt34013839_2016-04-23T10-51-30_v4.png?subformat=icon-1440">
        to check the correctness</a> of their changes.
        While collecting data, visualizing them help us to
        <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2008149">control that
            everything is running smoothly and without errors</a>. While
        cleaning and processing data, researchers 
        visualize intermediate
        data, 
        <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/AtlasPublic/EventDisplayRun2Physics/run311071_evt1452867343_2016-10-21T06-34-07-Vtx.png">
        to verify all the steps 
        </a>
         completed successfully.
        Eventually, when they analyze the experimental data while
        performing precise measurements or in the search new phenomena,
        they visualize their data to <a href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2012-169/figaux_19.png">
        validate their findings</a> and
        to <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2017847">show their results</a>.
