<div class="infocontent">
	<p>The excavation work under the Swiss country is completed. The
		underground cavern which will host the ATLAS detector is ready! At
		that time, if I remember correctly, it was the largest artificial
		cavern in the world.</p>

	<p>In the picture, Peter Jenni, the ATLAS spokesman at that time
		(the first on the left), the CERN Director General Luciano Maiani, and
		other personalities from the Swiss Confederation government and CERN,
		are visiting the cavern just before the inauguration.</p>

	<h2>A personal note</h2>
</div>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>I remember that day very well! I joined the ATLAS Experiment
		precisely at that time. In those months I was at CERN for the first
		time, as a Summer Student, and I was working on my Bachelor diploma
		work, within the ATLAS Data Acquisition group.</p>
		
	<p>On the inauguration day, on the 4th of June 2003, I visited the
		new cavern with many other ATLAS people. The cavern was huge. And
		really empty! In fact, its emptiness made it look even larger! I still
		remember the feeling of being there, together with other ATLAS people:
		even as a mere young student, I felt as I was part of a scientific
		collaboration, already.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Small note</i>: at that time, nobody could even image that exactly
		9 years later, on the same day, the ATLAS Collaboration will announce
		one of the most fundamental discoveries of the last decades: the
		discovery of the Higgs boson!
