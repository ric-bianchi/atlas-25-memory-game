	<p>...and, finally, the announcement! The two general-purpose
		experiments at the LHC ---ATLAS and CMS--- have finally collected and
		analyzed a fair amount of events showing features compatible with the
		Higgs boson and, on the 4th of June 2012, they jointly announce its
		discovery!</p>

	<p>In the picture, Peter Higgs and Francois Englert are waiting for
		the start of the seminar which will confirm the theory they started 50
		years earlier.</p>

	<h2>A personal note</h2>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>On that day...well, I was at work at CERN, of course! Everybody
		was waiting for the joint seminar. Of course, we from ATLAS knew the
		content of the ATLAS talk, already; and rumors had run, in the days
		before, about the content of the talk from the other experiment, CMS.
		But the excitement was very high, anyway!</p>
	<p>Personally, I was looking forward to seeing Higgs' and Englert's
		reaction. After the announcement, it has been nice to see the joy and
		the satisfaction on their faces.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Small note</i>: on the 4th of June 2003 the ATLAS cavern was
		inaugurated. Nine years later, one of the biggest discovery in
		particle physics was announced!
