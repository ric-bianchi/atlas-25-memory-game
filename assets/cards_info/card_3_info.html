	<p>The construction catwalks are now built, the cavern is ready to
		host the first pieces of the ATLAS detector. It is the 26th of October
		2004. The first superconducting magnet is installed: attached through
		a cable to a crane on the surface, its 100 tonnes are lowered for 100
		meters vertically through the pit into the cavern.</p>

<div class="infonote">

	<p>
		At that time I was in Rome, studying for my Master degree in Particle
		Physics. I had got a Bachelor degree (the Italian "Laurea", to be
		precise) the year before, with a diploma work on parallel programming
		techniques for the software of the <i>data flow</i> of the <a
			href="https://atlas.cern/discover/detector/trigger-daq">ATLAS
			data acquisition system</a>; but I did not know yet that I would have
		pursued my physics career on the ATLAS experiment.
